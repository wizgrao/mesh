<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
  <p>In this project, I implemented a series of geometric techniques to modify and render smooth curves and triangle meshes.
  The first part of the project deals with bezier curves and surfaces, which are ways of representing curves and smooth surfaces with only a few points.
  The second part of the project deals with making modifications to a triangle mesh stored in a half-edge data structure.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

<p>
De Casteljau's algorithm is a way of generating bezier curves using a set of control points. Essentially, we apply a recursive algorithm on the control points. We can think of the bezier curve as a function from a set of control points and a value \( t, 0 \leq t \leq 1\) to a point. This function traced out for all \(t\) gives the desired curve. If we only have one control point, we just return the control point. If there are more control points, we create a new set of control points by linearly interpolating adjacent control points according to \(t\). For example, if we had the points \( p_0 = \left( 0,0 \right),  p_1 =\left( 1,1 \right), p_2 =  \left( 2,0 \right) \) and \(t=0.25\) we would get new points \( p'_0 = (1-.25)p_0 + .25p_1, p'_1 = (1-.25)p_1 + .25p_2 \). We would then apply this algorithm again with these points and the same \(t\) to get the next set of points. We do this until we have one point left.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
<p> 
The algorithm from above can generalize for surfaces as well. Suppose we had a series of bezier curves. If we evaluate these at a particular \(t\) we get a set of points. We can use these points to construct another bezier curve. Now, we have a function thats parameterized by two variables, one to evaluate the first set of bezier curves and find a new bezier curve, and another to find the final point from that curve. So, this is a two dimensional surface.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>
<p> In this part of the project, we try to find the approximate normal vector to all of the vectors in the scene. We do this by taking the average of all of the triangle normals weighted by the area of the triangle. When we take the cross product of two vectors in a triangle, we get a vector in the direction of the normal with magnitude equal to two times the area of the triangle. So, if we add all of the cross products together, we get the weighted sum, which then we can normalize to get the final vector. This was implemented through the half edge data structure. For every edge coming out of a vertex, we can find the next half edge by taking the next of the twin of the half edge. for every two adjacent half edges coming out of the vertex, we can find the vector and take the cross products and find the weighed average that way.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>
<p> In this part of the project we implement an edge flip. Each edge in a mesh connects two triangles. These two triangles forms a quadrilateral (not necessarily planar) with the edge in the middle. Edge flipping just makes the edge connect the other two vertices instead of the ones that it is currently connected to.

We implement this with the half edge data structure by finding all of the faces, edges, half edges, and vertices that are affected and just reassign pointers to get the required topology.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>
<p> Edge splits are similar to flips, except instead of changing the edge we add two new edges and a vertex in the middle. This is implemented similarly except we have to construct a new vertex, 3 new edges, 6 new half edges, and 2 new faces. We assign the pointers accordingly.
<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
<p> To implement loop subdivision, we calculate the new positions based on a weighed average, split all of the edges, rotate all incorrect new edges, and then move all of the vertices to the right position.

<p>Same cube, except with subdivision. Notice that this is asymetric. This is due to the asymetric topology of the mesh.</p>

<img src="images/u6.png">
<p>Same cube edge but subdivided, note that the edge with the initial subdivisions is slightly sharper. This is because there are more control points on the edge, biasing the limit surface towards that edge.</p>

<p>Exact same model as above, but rotated to an unsplit edge. Notice that it isn't as sharp</p>
